# Introduction

This project focuses on constructing a hierarchical classification domain dictionary for the process industry, leveraging knowledge graphs. The process industry, encompassing metallurgy, petroleum, chemicals, building materials, and electricity, is essential for economic and societal development but faces challenges such as insufficient automation and skilled labor shortages. Our method includes efficient entity recognition and relationship extraction, effective updating and expansion of industrial entities, and systematic mapping of entity categories to build a comprehensive dictionary. This provides robust technical support for industrial knowledge management and intelligent manufacturing.

## Features
- **Hierarchical Classification**: Organizes domain-specific terms and concepts in a hierarchical structure for efficient data management and retrieval.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Utilizes knowledge graphs to interlink related concepts and provide context-aware information retrieval.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale industrial data with the ability to scale as needed.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adaptable to different domains within the process industry.
